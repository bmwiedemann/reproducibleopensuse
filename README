These tools are intended to make it easier
to verify that the binaries resulting from openSUSE builds are reproducible

for this, we rebuild locally from source
and compare the results with published binaries
using the build-compare script that abstracts away
some unavoidable (or unimportant) differences like rpm timestamps
