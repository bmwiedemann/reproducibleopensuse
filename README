These tools are intended to make it easier
to verify that the binaries resulting from openSUSE builds are reproducible

for this, we rebuild locally from source
and compare the results with published binaries
using the build-compare script that abstracts away
some unavoidable (or unimportant) differences like rpm timestamps


Setup:
1. git clone this repo

2. `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/reproducibleopensuse`

3. make sure you can build a package with `osc build --vm-type=kvm`
You might need to adjust your `~/.oscrc` - especially `build-vmdisk-rootsize` and `build-memory` values.


Usage:

You can rebuild one package using
rbk
in the package checkout dir
and you can rebuild a whole distribution using
rebuildmany *
or
rebuildmanyp
in the project checkout dir

You need an osc version that understands the --build-opt param
and a "build" version, that understands the --vm-custom-opt param
to pass the modified base clock time to kvm.
